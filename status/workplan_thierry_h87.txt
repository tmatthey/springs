Dynamics of material flow in a hybryd granular MD system


I have rewrittne the init routine. Now initialisation is 
instant when nlay1,nlay2 is big.

Lets focus on a reasonable number of particles for all the
simulations: ns1=ns2= 10-15 000

Results to produce:

1. DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY:

Simulations: Using springs as it is now with Porshels 
friction coeffisients. Now constraint on the motion and no 
external force. The only parameter to enter into code is
a Z_vfr denoting WHICH distance above the surface all particles
should have constant velocity. No "temperature regulator on
surface"

1.1: 3D plot of E_kin per Al particle
     of Al phase as function of vfr (fluid on top) and
    <p_al>  (pressure of the Al particles) as x,y axes.
 
1.2: 3D plot of E_rot as fig 1 per Al particle

1.3: 3D plot of E_surface per surface particle (ns2)

Main goal: How critical is the energy distribution on these parameters
and also the case when the surface becomes infinitely heavy and
infinitely strong strings betwen them (as in Porshel)
Velocity rangees: As for extrusion (vfr from 0.01 to 10 m/s)


2. VERTICAL VELOCITY FLOW PROFILE (averaged over x range (+/- L/2) 
   <V_Al(z)>:

2.1: Velocity profile as function of average fluid pressure (pressure of
the Al particles) and the vfr (fluid on top) parameter.
3D plot <v_Al(z)> is z axis, <p_Al> and vfr is x,y axes.

2.2: Compare <v(z)> with v(z) at two selected pressures given by the two
curves I have got from Steinar from his forge2 - FEM calculations.

2.3: 1. and 2. is done with "infinite heavy" and infinite rigid surface

2.4:  Let the surface be less heavy and decrease the spring constant between 
the surface particles and make a (some) figure 1 to see how the
velocity profile depends on TEMPERATURE.
THe surface particles should here be subject to constant temperature
dynamics... (small change in velocity_verlet / JP does that at this point)

3. THE NATURE OF FRICTION (stick slip)

Simulation performed with constant temperature constraint on surface: T_surf.

3.1 A 3D plot parallel pressure (frik/L1)  vs. normal pressure load/L1  and
T_surf for the simulation in 2.4: Select a "typical mass ration between the
Al and surface particles (1:2 Al vs. Fe) and one of the "best" spring
constants between the surface.
