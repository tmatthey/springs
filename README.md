## Molecular dynamics simulations of sliding friction in a
dense granular material ##

T Matthey and J P Hansen

Friction  in  a  dense  two-dimensional  granular  material  is  studied  by  molecular dynamics  simulations.   Initially  the  particles  are  ordered  in  a  triangular  lattice  where  the  top layer  feels  a  constant  vertical  pressure  and  horizontal  velocity  field.    The  dynamics  of  the material  at  low  velocities  is  found  to  be  characterized  by  avalanche-type  motion  during  short time  intervals  followed  by  long  stationary  periods  of  internal  stress  buildup.   At  low  external pressures,  the  time-averaged  shear  stress  is  found  to  be  nearly  constant  for  low  values  of  the normal pressure and proportional to the load for higher pressures.
